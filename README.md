The Database Administrator app is a command-line application designed for institutions to facilitate the management of student enrollments and dues payments.
Users can specify the number of students they wish to enroll and provide details such as name and level. 
The app automatically generates student IDs, with the first digit reflecting their grade level.
Additionally, users can view outstanding balances and make tuition payments, with a fixed price associated with each enrolled course.
